  The com.cyberfront.cmrdt.manager package includes the core classes to build and manage a commutative CRDT for managing JSON document
  updates using the JSON Patch standard.  The final result of the CRDT is a JSON document.  In some case, certain operations on the
  document may not be consistent with the document, and those operations are ignored when encountered.
